# Summative 3

## Challenge Description

Summative Challenge 3 - Oyster Eating Competition (Due on or before 17th November)
Goal
The goal of this challenge is to demonstrate the following things:

Loops
Arrays
Output to a file
More advanced techniques are not required, but you may include them if you wish.

Setting Up Your Project
For this summative challenge you should use your digital portfolio repository. You should complete this work in your Digital Portfolio Repository in GitHub.

Problem Specification
"At the New Orleans Oyster Festival, eight eaters will slurp down as many mollusks as they can in the allotted eight minutes. The winner takes home $1,000 from Major League Eating (MLE), which also oversees the ESPN-televised Nathanâ€™s Famous hot dog eating contest on Coney Island every summer." (The world of competitive oyster eating: 'your stomach is like a human Tetris' | Food | The GuardianLinks to an external site.)

You are tasked with writing a program that allows you to enter the number of competitors in the competition, the name of each competitor, and the number of oysters each competitor ate. Once all the competitors are entered you should sort them with respect to the number of oysters eaten (write your own sorting algorithm - do not use the built in sort), output them to the Console and save the results to a file called results.txt.

The output should look something like this:

You should also write them to a file called "results.txt".

Tips

Split the problem into stages
Store scores in one array and names in another array (each of the appropriate type)
Write a bubble sort to sort the scores array - at the same time update the names array so that they stay in sync
Write the sorted arrays to the Console
Write the sorted arrays to a file

## Code Listing

```cs
// See https://aka.ms/new-console-template for more information
Console.WriteLine("Oyster Eating Competition");
Console.WriteLine("How many competitors are there?");
int competitorsNumber = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine());

int[]numberOfOysters = new int[competitorsNumber];
string[]competitorsName = new string[competitorsNumber];

for (int i = 0; i < competitorsNumber; i++)
{
    Console.WriteLine("What is competitor number "+(i+1)+"'s name?" );
    competitorsName[i] =(Console.ReadLine());
    Console.WriteLine("How many oysters did " + competitorsName[i] +" eat?");
    numberOfOysters[i] = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine());
}
int tempNumber = 0;
string tempName;
for(int i=0; i<numberOfOysters.Length; i++)
{
    for(int j=0;  j<numberOfOysters.Length-1; j++)
    {
        if (numberOfOysters[j] < numberOfOysters[j + 1])
        {
            tempNumber = numberOfOysters[j+1];
            numberOfOysters[j + 1] = numberOfOysters[j];
            numberOfOysters[j] = tempNumber;
            tempName = competitorsName[j + 1];
            competitorsName[j + 1] = competitorsName[j];
            competitorsName[j]= tempName;
        }
    }
}
for(int i = 0;i < numberOfOysters.Length; i++)
{
    Console.WriteLine((i+1)+". "+ competitorsName[i] + " ate " + numberOfOysters[i] + " oysters" );
}
using (StreamWriter writetext = new StreamWriter("results.txt"))
{
    for (int i = 0; i < numberOfOysters.Length; i++)
    {
        writetext.WriteLine((i + 1) + ". " + competitorsName[i] + " ate " + numberOfOysters[i] + " oysters");
    }
}
```
