# Summative 4
## Challenge Description

Summative Challenge 4 - Programming Portfolio Results Calculator Revisited (Due on or before 1st December)
Goals
Use methods to breakdown a large problem into smaller parts, reduce scope and improve readability
Read input from a file
Setting Up Your Project
For this summative challenge you should use your digital portfolio repository. You should complete this work in your Digital Portfolio Repository in GitHub.

If you have not already accepted this assignment in GitHub classroom you can do so by clicking this link: https://classroom.github.com/a/JN1fvSJNLinks to an external site.

Problem Specification
You have been provided with data files containing the marks of students on the Programming Portfolio module.

Your task is to do the following.

Ask the user to select a file from a list of available files with the .mark extension from the current directory
Load the data from the file
Calculate the overall module marks for each student according to the rules described in ðŸ“’Summative Challenge 2
Note that in this case there are a total of 9 digital portfolio marks - one for each challenge.
To account for unexpected absence we award the best 4 challenge marks of the first 5 challenges, and the best 3 challenge marks of the last 4 challenges to generate a mark out of 35 from 7 challenges
Count the number of students with 1st class, 2:1, 2:2 and 3rd class results and output this to the console
Sort the students by overall module mark
Output the sorted results to another file in the specified format
You should pay special attention to your use of methods to breakdown a large problem into smaller parts, reduce scope and improve readability.

Input
Each line of the file contains data about a single student. The data is in the following format.

Student:[ID:2022232445,LastName:Grey,FirstName:Simon],Marks:[Challenges:[2, 3, 4, 5, 3, 2, 4, 5, 5],Exam:7,Capstone:85]
Console Output
The console output should look something like this - in this case the 11th file - 326Students.mark was selected:

File Output
The output file should have the same filename as the input file, but the .mark extension should be removed, and the output file should end with "Output.txt"

Each line in the file should include one student. The file output should be in the format Mark - FirstName LastName (ID)

Lines should be sorted in descending mark order. The output file for the "5StudentsOneEachClassification.mark" file should be called "5StudentsOneEachClassificationOutput.txt" and should look like this;

Test Data
The test data has been designed to help you test specific aspects of your program. You can download all the test files together from this link TestInputFiles.zipDownload TestInputFiles.zip

Working with Files
There is some advice about working with files in Visual Studio at Working with Files in Visual Studio
